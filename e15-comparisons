' Basic solution: display message with each credit card brand
Sub Basic()
    ' Dim and give value to variables
    Dim Column As Integer
    Column = 1
    Dim Row As Integer
    ' Determine last row
    Row = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    ' Loop to display message box for each credit card
    For i = 2 To Row
        If Cells(1 + i, Column).Value <> Cells(i, Column).Value Then
            MsgBox (Cells(i, 1).Value)
        End If
    Next i

' Advanced solution: create a new table and include charges
Sub Advanced()
    ' Dim and give value to variables
    Dim Column As Integer

    Dim Total As Long
    Total = 0
    Dim Row As Integer

    ' For loop to check the cards and amounts
    For i = 2 To Row
        ' Check if value changes between rows
        If Cells(1 + i, Column).Value = Cells(i, Column).Value Then
            Total = Total + Cells(i, 3).Value
        ' Print information in respective cells when value changes
        Else
            Total = Total + Cells(i, 3).Value
