# vbacoding_week2
Second week! Got through Excel and started coding in VBA.

In this repository, VBA files are included for the different exercises
I completed during my second week in the Data Analytics Bootcamp. If 
an Excel file was provided to solve the problem, it is included.

Some skills I mastered during this week are working with cells, ranges,
formatting, loops, conditionals, and multiple worksheets.

**I am excited and eager to get to learn new programming languages in the following weeks!**
